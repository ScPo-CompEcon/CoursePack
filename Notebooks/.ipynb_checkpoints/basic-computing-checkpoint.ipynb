    "\t* Traditional Solutions to this: Passing the high-speed threshold.\n",
    "\t* Using `Rcpp` or `Cython` etc is a bit like [Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1). You loose control the moment you pass the barrier to `C++` for a little bit. (Even though those are great solutions.) If the `C++` part of your code becomes large, testing this code becomes increasingly difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The Fundamental Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer Time (Your Time) is Much More Expensive than Computing Time\n",
    "\n",
    "* It may well be that the runtime of a fortran program is one third of the time it takes to run the program in julia, or anything else for that matter.\n",
    "* However, the time it takes to **develop** that program is very likely to be (much) longer in fortran. \n",
    "* Particularly if you want to hold your program to the same quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given my personal experience with many of the above languagues, I think `julia` is a very good tool for economists with non-trivial computational tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "# A Second Fundamental Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regardless of the software you use, there is one main problem with computation.\n",
    "* It concerns **speed vs accuracy**.\n",
    "* You may be able to do something very fast, but at very small accuracy (i.e. with a high numerical margin of error)\n",
    "* On the other hand, you may be able to get a very accurate solution, but it may take you an irrealistic amount of time to get there.\n",
    "* You have to face that tradeoff and decide for yourself what's best.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Donald Knuth's paper \"Structured Programming With GoTo Statements\", he wrote: \"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: **premature optimization is the root of all evil**. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "> Even with the best validation, it’s very hard to achieve perfect quality in software. Here are some typical residual defect rates (bugs left over after the software has shipped) per kloc (one thousand lines of source code):\n",
    ">\n",
    ">  * 1 - 10 defects/kloc: Typical industry software.\n",
    ">  * 0.1 - 1 defects/kloc: High-quality validation. The Java libraries might achieve this level of correctness.\n",
    ">  * 0.01 - 0.1 defects/kloc: The very best, safety-critical validation. NASA and companies like Praxis can achieve this level.\n",
    ">\n",

    "## Ariane 5 blows up because of a bug\n",
    "\n",
    "> It took the European Space Agency 10 years and $7 billion to produce Ariane 5, a giant rocket capable of hurling a pair of three-ton satellites into orbit with each launch and intended to give Europe overwhelming supremacy in the commercial space business.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All it took to explode that rocket less than a minute into its maiden voyage last June, scattering fiery rubble across the mangrove swamps of French Guiana, was a small computer program trying to stuff a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This shutdown occurred 36.7 seconds after launch, when the guidance system's own computer tried to convert one piece of data -- the sideways velocity of the rocket -- from a 64-bit format to a 16-bit format. The number was too big, and an overflow error resulted. When the guidance system shut down, it passed control to an identical, redundant unit, which was there to provide backup in case of just such a failure. But the second unit had failed in the identical manner a few milliseconds before. And why not? It was running the same software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## NASA Mars Orbiter crashes because of a bug\n",
    "\n",
    "> For nine months, the Mars Climate Orbiter was speeding through space and speaking to NASA in metric. But the engineers on the ground were replying in non-metric English.\n",
    "> It was a mathematical mismatch that was not caught until after the $125-million spacecraft, a key part of NASA's Mars exploration program, was sent crashing too low and too fast into the Martian atmosphere. The craft has not been heard from since.\n",
    "> Noel Henners of Lockheed Martin Astronautics, the prime contractor for the Mars craft, said at a news conference it was up to his company's engineers to assure the metric systems used in one computer program were compatible with the English system used in another program. The simple conversion check was not done, he said.\n",

    "## LA Airport Air Traffic Control shuts down because of a bug\n",
    "\n",
    ">(IEEE Spectrum) -- It was an air traffic controller's worst nightmare. Without warning, on Tuesday, 14 September, at about 5 p.m. Pacific daylight time, air traffic controllers lost voice contact with 400 airplanes they were tracking over the southwestern United States. Planes started to head toward one another, something that occurs routinely under careful control of the air traffic controllers, who keep airplanes safely apart. But now the controllers had no way to redirect the planes' courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The controllers lost contact with the planes when the main voice communications system shut down unexpectedly. To make matters worse, a backup system that was supposed to take over in such an event crashed within a minute after it was turned on. The outage disrupted about 800 flights across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inside the control system unit is a countdown timer that ticks off time in milliseconds. The VCSU uses the timer as a pulse to send out periodic queries to the VSCS. It starts out at the highest possible number that the system's server and its software can handle—232. It's a number just over 4 billion milliseconds. When the counter reaches zero, the system runs out of ticks and can no longer time itself. So it shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Counting down from 232 to zero in milliseconds takes just under 50 days. The FAA procedure of having a technician reboot the VSCS every 30 days resets the timer to 232 almost three weeks before it runs out of digits.\n",
